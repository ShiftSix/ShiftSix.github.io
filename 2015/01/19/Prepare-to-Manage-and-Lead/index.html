		<p>This is the first assignment of our Management class. We need to read a story about Eugene Kranz before answering the following questions. The Story is from Michael Useem’s book, <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=yv1E1-7vINYC&amp;pg=PT72&amp;lpg=PT72&amp;dq=eugene+kranz+returns+apollo+13+to+earth&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=05--zIVYHl&amp;sig=i2YqU52zGXSv-I0euAXzisgQSKA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=z6i9VP2aEYGcNrrpgpgK&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=eugene%20kranz%20returns%20apollo%2013%20to%20earth&amp;f=false" target="_blank" rel="external">The Leadership Moment</a>, <strong>Chapter 3, Eugene Kranz Returns Apollo 13 to Earth</strong>.<br>The first two questions are about your understanding of the story. The third question is about yourself, to evaluate your strengths and shortcomings as a manager or a leader.<br><strong>Instructor</strong>: Professor Ted Ryan</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>PRE-CRISIS Preparation</strong>: In his two years as Flight Director prior to Apollo 13’s crisis, Kranz implemented a number of innovative organizational initiatives.  What were Kranz’ key organizational initiatives – BEFORE the crisis occurred – that turned out to be critical to the successful return of Apollo 13?  For each innovative initiative you cite, state why/how it became critical to Apollo 13’s safe return.<br><em>Note: These initiatives were “management” and/or “leadership” initiatives – but for now, don’t worry about whether an initiative was more management or leadership.</em></p>
<p>First, Kranz had <strong>comprehensive understanding of his team members</strong>. He knew not only their strengths, but also their shortcomings and how to stimulate their full potential based on his understanding. Therefore, in a time-critical and true emergency environment, Kranz could assign the right people on right positions. For example, when recruiting Bill Peters from the Gold Team, despite the doubt from other flight directors, Kranz believed that Peters’ exceptional experience would be crucial to the crisis, while he might need someone “to bring out the pieces”. The same situation happened when recruiting John Aaron as well. Naturally, these people did not let Kranz down. We can say that, everyone in the team was dealing with the task he/she was expert in. Consequently each function of the team just needed to focus on its own problem. The absence of disturbance was one of the key factors to make prompt and accurate decisions.<br>In addition to Kranz’ own familiarity with the team, he particularly devoted attention to the <strong>team’s efficiency when working together</strong>. As mentioned in the case, “its members had developed the ability to compensate for each other when the chips get down”. His effort included encouraging the team members to know one another, and then to communicate and trust one another. He arranged his flight teams into their own baseball league and the team challenged the astronaut teams on the football field. The active team-building events consolidated the team together and established strong reliance among multiple teams. As a result, even under the most critical circumstance, people in Room 210 functioned methodically. Similarly, during the early period of the crisis, Kranz could restructure the team and regroup people across levels, between outside contractors and inside employees without concerns.<br>These two innovative initiatives guaranteed both Kranz and his team the access to all required resources. And these people had been long prepared for working in the most efficient way. Therefore they could reach an optimal conclusion under severe pressure.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Kranz’ Attributes/Behaviors</strong>:  Our reading describes how Kranz prepared himself technically for his responsibilities as Flight Director.  He was superbly trained and had great technological expertise.  However, it is clear that Kranz’ technological competence alone was not enough for him to lead Apollo 13 safely back to earth.  What were Kranz’ most important NON-technical characteristics that enabled him to lead Apollo 13 to a successful conclusion?</p>
<p>First, Kranz’ <strong>calmness</strong> was crucial of successfully managing this crisis. Although technological expertise and comprehensive experience were the foundation of calmness, this characteristic required continual training other than growing naturally. Throughout the crisis, Kranz kept seeking orderly analysis. Other than blind optimism, it ensured that Kranz could objectively evaluate the situation and then make accurate decision.<br>We cannot neglect Kranz’ <strong>infectious personal</strong> characteristic as well, which was shown in many details during the accident. For example, As soon as Kranz realized the sign of panic in Mission control, he started to influence the team with encouraging suggestions. “Let’s solve the problem.” “Let’s not make it any worse by guessing”. During the crisis, he exhorted his team to concentrate on “what was working, rather than focusing on what was not”. He believed optimistic might not be sufficiency to a favorable outcome, but definitely necessity. So he used his influence to arouse the team’s morale. The smooth cooperation of the Tiger Team under such huge pressure proved this point of view. </p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Your Readiness to Manage and Lead</strong>:  You may not face a crisis as severe as a crippled spaceship, with a crew in jeopardy.  However, as an engineering manager, you will quickly face serious challenges that will test you.  Suppose you were faced with a serious organizational challenge today.  How ready are you? </p>
<p>a. List three <strong>positive personal non-technical qualities/behaviors</strong> that would help you manage/lead others, especially in difficult circumstances. For each of these qualities/ behaviors, describe a practical step you can take to strengthen them further.</p>
<p>i.    <strong>Calmness</strong><br>Kranz’ successful story proved how important calmness could be, especially in critical circumstances. I believe most of my calmness comes from my various work and projects experience. As analyzed in Kranz’ case, this positive attitude usually based on one’s qualification in certain situations. Or it will become blind optimism, which cannot be helpful at all.<br>Therefore I need to equip myself with adequate industrial knowledge. Then cultivate the habits of simulating potential hardness and seeking for multiple solutions. Theses habits will prepare me for different kinds of unexpected difficulties and accidents.</p>
<p>ii.    <strong>Accountable</strong><br>Accountable is a reputation earned through long-time effective work, strong team spirit and last but not the least, honesty towards failures. This reputation assures more challenging management positions when accidents happen.<br>At present, being accountable is relatively easy because the projects I have dealt with are less complex. While I should regard them as good opportunities to strengthen my accountability. A strictly conducted agenda is definitely good to keep the project on time. Making reasonable commitment is more practical in crisis than setting unrealistic goals. Getting to know the team eliminates the risk when working together. As a student or entry level employee, mistakes and failures usually do not cause chaotic consequences. But learning from them is beneficial in the long term. This attitude will also increase the reputation of accountability. </p>
<p>iii.    <strong>Structure</strong><br>The characteristic of being organized can effectively avoid panic, confusion and flurry when crisis comes. Academic study is a well structured environment where classes are arranged at fixed time and syllabuses show exactly the tasks in the semester. I believe students tend to have a good structured analysis methodology. While in real working environment, more constraints, roles, resources will be involved.<br>Actually the project charter we write in every case study report is very helpful to strengthen the ability of structurally thinking. It is t. At first this section might be regarded just as a compulsory part of the report. But as time goes by I realize that a project charter is not just for the readers to grasp a rough idea of the situation. It shows my understanding of this project. To compose a concise project charter instructs me to read the case with structured purposes from the very beginning.<br>In addition to the case studies required by classes, I can also develop this characteristic through learning my own cases. The stories can come from news, exchanging experience with others and extending the classroom study from documents. </p>
<p>b. List three of your <strong>weaker qualities/behaviors</strong> – areas of vulnerability that you will need to change and develop in order to manage/lead others effectively, especially in difficult circumstances. Refer to your Personal Development Plan.  For each of these qualities/behaviors, describe a practical step you can take to strengthen them.</p>
<p>i.    <strong>Flexibility</strong><br>I do like well-organized projects. As a result, it may cause the lack of flexibility.<br>First of all, overcome the upset feelings towards changes. With a positive attitude to uncertainties, I shall strength my adaptability through experiences. Try not to focus on the events I am used to. New challenges bring fresh opportunities and increase the possibility of meeting with changes. With more experience of dealing with changes, I shall become more skilled at anticipating potential incidents. </p>
<p>ii.    <strong>Patience</strong><br>One of the vulnerabilities I have now is that I tend to become impatient when facing people with totally different background from me, especially when we fail to understand each other after several attempts.<br>Considering the responsibilities of a manager or a leader, patience is so important in that this character is always tangling with people from different industries with various personalities. And the key mission is to unite these people working together towards a common purpose.<br>To get in touch with people from other industries will obviously be helpful. It will broaden my understanding of different fields. Possible channels include personal network, industrial events and public media. When conducting these interactions, keep in mind that the conversation should not be limited to our shared topics. Instead, I need to encourage the other person to talk about his or her work experience and insights on the industry. It will not only enrich my knowledge, but also train my skills of obtaining brand new ideas. When misunderstanding or confusion occurs, try to use another way of expression or seek for an analogy familiar by both sides, other than emphasizing the same sentence repeatedly.</p>
<p>iii.    <strong>Maturity</strong><br>I do not think maturity equals to insensibility. Instead, it is more about regulate the emotion, especially under severe pressures. Comparing to calmness, which is mainly towards the situation, maturity includes a comprehensive management of emotions for events as well as human beings.<br>When mingling with different people, pay attention to their characteristics and behavior pattern. This experience will help to form thorough tactics of communication and interaction. This ability can also be cultivated through textbook learning. One of the recommendations is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Berne" target="_blank" rel="external">Eric Berne</a>’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transactional_analysis" target="_blank" rel="external">Transactional Analysis</a>.<br>In addition, a proper way of relieving stress should be developed. It can be reading, exercise or meditation.</p>
