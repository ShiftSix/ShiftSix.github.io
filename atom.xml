    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>连上了学校的vpn，我的dropbox文件夹终于可以颤颤巍巍地同步了。<br>有时候觉得自己也是no zuo no die——明明国内其他小伙伴在网上也过得好好的，留学回来的也不过是偶尔抱怨下facebook上不去然后手机上装个vpn也就搞定了，为什么我每次一想起上网就满满的幽怨……<br>首先我原本引以为傲的“云端办公”都变成单机版了——我在dropbox有一个和本地同步的文件夹，专门存档当前频繁使用的文件。比如说申请工作期间的简历、cover letter和申请进度汇总表；旅行期间的各种凭证扫描件、攻略、自制的行程单。这样我就可以随时在手机上查看或者做一些简单的更新；自己电脑不在身边的时候也可以从网站下载下来编辑。<br>平时喜欢拍照，即使不出游也举着相机快门乱按。都说拍照片要懂得取舍——专业摄影师都这样。于是g+的自动备份功能对于选择困难症患者来说简直是天降甘霖——每次从SD卡把照片拷出来，g+就自动备份到云端；然后我再挑出满意的精修，剩下的删光！毕竟笔记本那点儿空间……更让我喜欢的功能是，手机可以随时访问自己的google主页挑照片，随手就po到各种社交网站了。iPhone的摄像头再好，哪里比得过单反的300dpi？<br>我们很多课程都需要用到雪片纷飞的case book. 所以开会讨论、做作业时常常用电子版——笔记本大小的iPad，装满了整个学期所有课程的教材，做笔记时的圈圈画画全都用google drive或者dropbox的账号同步起来，到哪里打开来都一样。不过现在也没有case要看啦，这里影响稍微小一点。</p>
<p>好了，你说我no zuo no die我也认了——“你可以用百度云管家代替dropbox啊”“国内很多网盘用起来也很方便啊”……谁让你信不过无处不在的大百度？谁让你看不上国内软件偏要用墙外同步的Notability和Day One? Chrome的搜索栏报废了？不喜欢百度你也可以换成Bing嘛！那些歇菜的chrome插件，用火狐替代啊！什么？Any.do也不能同步了？国内也有很多待办事项的app你没必要吊死在一棵树上嘛！Pushbullet好棒啊！文字、图片、链接、地址，想发到哪儿就发到哪儿，太适合我这种移动设备过多的人使用了，暂时也没有合适的替代……</p>
<p>这些我都忍了，我可以用我信得过的替代品（百度呵呵），或者我自己翻出去就好，但是总不能强迫别人也和我一块儿翻吧？虽然工作和生活中的文件分享、合作编辑的情况不至于像读书时那么频繁——每门课都有Team, 经常都是在Google Drive建一个文件夹，各自做好了往里面丢；甚至六个人坐在一间房里开会，每个人都对着电脑在线上一起编辑同一个文档——但遇到分享大文件、多人会议之类的情况，我还是感到非常无助。好了啦，不要作啦，就用一下QQ好啦！</p>
<p>作为“天生爱吐槽”的我，也忍不住吐槽自己明明才出去一年，为什么变得如此“崇洋媚外”。可是我记得我出去之前国内的网络环境好像也没有恶化到这种地步啊——Google不能用，但邮件还是可以收的；dropbox和Instagram也是可以用的；你知道当我听说g+可以免费无限制存储高精度图片的时候（之前我都是压缩上传的啊啊啊啊）已经身在国内的我有多忧桑嘛？难道google就真的那么好嘛？哈哈哈我就是好愿意把我的一切都上传到云端分享给google，让它了解我分析我，进而推荐适合我的广告、推送我需要的通知、在合适的时候周到地提醒我待办事宜。我能够认识到线上共享的隐患，能够遇见个人信息泄露可能造成的影响，但我坚信云端共享是互联网的未来，大数据此刻可能过热却是信息时代发展的必然。不仅是因为数据挖掘、趋势研究已经逐渐被证明它们存在的价值，也因为互联网的普及、可穿戴设备的渗入正在以生产技术难以匹敌的速度创造着大量数据，本地存储必将被淘汰！所以即使有隐患，我还是愿意走在前面，并且选择我更信得过的服务。</p>
<p>啊，扯远了……本来只是吐槽越来越高越管越宽的墙，为什么境界莫名升华了呢……我就是立个贴，要好好把家里的网络环境改造好（嗯，任重而道不远），将来有了小孩，要让他成长在没有墙的环境里！想想我从没多少国外好友的时期就开始用facebook了，就是坚信有一天我们终能像别人一样自由地上网，也是很心酸的……</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Was designated to be the MEM Hooding Ceremony speaker of my classmates at Duke University. Special Thanks to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stacithornton" target="_blank" rel="external">Staci Thornton</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alecweisman" target="_blank" rel="external">Alec Weisman</a> for the suggestions and proofreading.<br><a href="https://youtu.be/dgzRpy86zrc?t=9m44s" target="_blank" rel="external">Speech Video</a><br><img src="http://ww1.sinaimg.cn/mw690/72a818edjw1es0j78idfbj20qo0hsgnv.jpg" alt=""><br>Good afternoon. Distinguished guests, faculty and staff, family and friends, thank you for coming today, to show your support for us and our achievements! Congratulations, my dear classmates! It’s an honor to be standing up here to review the past and look forward. Thank you for giving me this opportunity…..I am sure you won’t regret it.<br>What makes MEM special, the <a href="http://memp.pratt.duke.edu/" target="_blank" rel="external">Master of Engineering Management</a> program? I invite you to look back at the year together with me. Yes, please join me! (the following section involves some interactions with the audience) Who said “if I don’t see you at seminars, you are gonna see me.”? (Dr. Murray). Yes, we have the most conscientious and generous staff and faculty. Thank you, Dr. Glass, Dr. Fox, Dr. Murray, for bringing us an insightful, challenging and enjoyable program. Who has been married for 13,314 days till today? (CJ Skender) Yes, we have the most experienced and charming professors. Thank you, to all of the professors…for providing us with a vivid perspective of the industry.  Your dedication to teaching doesn’t stop in the classroom, but continues through lunches and coffee hours. Do you still remember our very first Guide to Durham, with all the interesting places to eat, to do and to buy? (Bridget) And who always brought dogs to MEM suite during the intense final weeks? (Lorelle) yes, we have an amazing and trustworthy staff. Thank you, Staci, Susan, Erin, Jamila, Bridget, and Lorelle, for making us feel like a part of this big family, and a part of a winning team. Who has read every version of our resumes and cover letters? (Jenny, etc.) Yes, we have the most reliable career service team. Thank you, Jenny, Leah, Christina, for being available, helpful and encouraging all the time on our career path.<br>Friday afternoon is our favorite time at MEM. Not only because of the food from all around the world, which is important, but also because of the insightful seminars and splendid cultural presentations. Not only do we have the opportunity to gain close connections with industry experts, but also to learn cultural diversity from each other. The rest of the week is delightful as well. We spent three months running a medicine company; went ecstatic or crazy with the up and down of the stock price. We successfully led a chaotic team to complete the project in time even though our poor boss Ana left the company with 200 failed projects. We helped Ella and Tomas deal with all the legal issues when they launched their love bubble company. The courses were sometimes frustrating; the deadlines were always one after another, but in the end they made us feel accomplished.<br>Looking forward, I’d like to share with you three things about choice, which I learned from MEM, and will be invaluable for the future.<br>Staci always says, I can do nothing if you find me after the course add and drop ends. The choice of courses determines our sleep quality, happiness index, and—to some extent—our final grades. It is important but we only have two weeks to make the choice. If you miss the deadline, not even Staci can help you. So seize the day and make your choice! Opportunities are passing by never to return. If you meet someone friendly and charming, don’t hesitate; go and talk to him, or her. Because they will leave and you may not see them again. that is an advice for attending career fairs. We are afforded many opportunities in life… take advantage and make the choices in time.<br>The second thing I want to leave us today is that there is no need to regret the choices you have made. In our  first seminar, Jason McMain said “to plan is worthwhile but the plan itself is worthless”. This is the fascination of our time. Things change so quickly that we can no longer predict what will happen next. A bad choice now may turn into an opportunity later. Glancing down and regretting on the past will only blind you from what lies ahead. Just like sitting in class, drifting away for only two minutes, you will feel completely lost about the concept. But if you then try to go back and start again, you will miss the whole class and will need more than three hours to make up what you missed. What if we really make some bad choices? In the PharmaSim Simulation, we probably all make some…questionable decisions, reducing the price, killing a product, spending money on meaningless tests. Instead of blaming each other or regretting it, we always analyzed and reported the data in order to find better solutions. We need to convert bad choices into opportunities.<br>Last but not the least, your choices deserve respect; so do others. One of the most distinguishing aspects of the MEM program is that we learn from engineers with background in all kinds of industries and cultures. We argued fiercely in class discussion. We had tears in team projects. But agreeing to disagree is the catalyst of progress. Outside the classroom, we have been able to collect on the dividends of diversity. Our classmates invited us to parties for Diwali; we had mooncakes for the Mid-autumn Festival. We celebrated New Year’s Day together; learned French, Russian and Spanish. We explain to each other the meanings of our names. This experience with you has taught me to embrace our differences. So, even when I cannot understand the choices made by others, I learn to respect it.<br>Life is a one-way journey. Our choices enlighten the way. Some choices lead us to spectacular scenery; some bring us barriers and ambiguities. But we never know what will happen next. What we can do is to learn from experience and make better choices. MEM has equipped us with the appreciation of sceneries, the knowledge to turn barriers into opportunities and the courage to face ambiguities. While our beautiful, wonderful, magical time here at Duke is coming to an end, a new journey is waiting for us just outside that door. As engineers and future leaders, we are prepared for the challenging choices that lie ahead of us.<br>Now for our memories slideshow at MEM put together by Kruti Jain. </p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The presentation on Duke MEM Internship Assessment Showcase 2015 Spring. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TR0UEFcWhPA" target="_blank" rel="external">Presentation Video</a><br><img src="http://ww3.sinaimg.cn/mw690/72a818edgw1erd01e0lblj20zk0k00un.jpg" alt=""><br>Today I would like to talk about working with science, and working with people. This is where my passion lies. Just like this program, engineering and management. It is easier to be expert in one field. But how to bring the greater energy from the combination, is a long learning process. I’m glad to share with you how I learned to work with science and work with people. </p>
<p><img src="http://ww1.sinaimg.cn/mw690/72a818edgw1erd01g4odnj20zk0k0gnn.jpg" alt=""><br>Back in college, I learned mainly from textbook. Then I joined work, where I learned from practice. Here at MEM, I believe you have the same feeling as I do, we learn from people. </p>
<p><img src="http://ww2.sinaimg.cn/mw690/72a818edgw1erd01hqfzyj20zk0k040p.jpg" alt=""><br>This was me, four years ago, when I graduated from Fudan University. Looking back, this degree equipped me with basic qualities as an engineer; and today I am still benefiting from these skills. Here by textbook, it does not just mean paper book, or electronic versions. It means that life at campus is more straightforward comparing to real life.<br><img src="http://ww3.sinaimg.cn/mw690/72a818edgw1erd01jsnqyj20zk0k0n0z.jpg" alt=""><br>I realized the fact when I volunteered at the world exposition in my junior year of college. We had held big events at campus before, but I still felt lost when facing so many people from all around the world. They are not like formulas that you can calculate or inference! why did they just get anxious or angry at me when I was performing my duty? That was the time I decided to learn more about people. Luckily, my experience at campus and internship help me land on a job in marketing. Where, I started to swift my learning focus from working with science to working with people. </p>
<p><img src="http://ww1.sinaimg.cn/mw690/72a818edgw1erd01l949wj20zk0k0jty.jpg" alt=""><br>This picture was two years ago when I was presenting our ecommerce project to my colleagues in Henkel. Henkel is a German chemical company famous for its industrial adhesive products. My job was in China marketing department, focusing on digital marketing and media relations. Here I’d like to share this online authentication project.</p>
<p><img src="http://ww3.sinaimg.cn/mw690/72a818edgw1erd01ncknij20zk0k0tc4.jpg" alt=""><br>Fake product was a unique problem in China. We do not have much material to learn from other regions. In addition, this project involved various internal and external departments, which increased the potential conflicts.  But communication and logistic issues can be easily overcame, even for a new professional. You just need to practice and learn fast.  As for the lack of experience, we still have indirect experience to learn from. The distribution management department had dealt with offline authentication cases before; our legal department had close cooperation with legal-enforcement agencies; our sales team were familiar with the local market.<br><img src="http://ww4.sinaimg.cn/mw690/72a818edgw1erd01panf1j20zk0k00ww.jpg" alt=""><br>Another barriers in this cross department project was that people have different interests and appeals. Some department just want to shut down the fake website; some want to investigate deeper but they do not have enough budget to support. It is so important that we have marketing lead this project that we make sure all voices are heard and negotiate in between to convert conflict to contract, which eventually brought benefit to everyone.<br>The successful of this project created a marketing example in the company. Evidently it saved company losses and consolidated brand equity. Moreover, it enhanced the relationship between departments. Thanks to all the conflicts we had and the close cooperation afterwards. </p>
<p><img src="http://ww1.sinaimg.cn/mw690/72a818edgw1erd01roinoj20zk0k0aeo.jpg" alt=""><br>I summarized the key takeaways from my three-year work experience in these four words.<br>Capability, is the one crucial but I do not worry about too much. We are engineers; we have solid technical background and we learn fast.<br>Adaptability, is another essential quality for new professionals. Things change quickly when dealing with people. And we keep meeting with new situations. My responsibilities from website and email marketing to mobile devices and ecommerce. I had never expected that my job could be anything about authentication.<br>Initiative works as complement of adaptability. A lot of successful business leaders I interviewed mentioned one thing in common that they keep close track to industrial news and actively participate in networking events. This enthusiasm, or curiosity guides you to prepare in advance.<br>Finally, no matter how cruel, stressful business world is, I’ still want to keep my genuineness. It wins me trust and respect. Genuineness also means that I am willing to accept who I am. Always have a clear idea of what I want. Just do not get lost among all kinds of values and temptations. </p>
<p><img src="http://ww1.sinaimg.cn/mw690/72a818edgw1erd01tgz46j20zk0k0adc.jpg" alt=""><br>That is why I decided to come to this program, to know more about people like me.  Here I learnt more than from textbook, more than practice. Because it is the engineers have taught me, how to work with people.<br><img src="http://ww3.sinaimg.cn/mw690/72a818edgw1erd01vbybqj20zk0k0jv3.jpg" alt=""><br>I love the classroom atmosphere. Not only in class, but also the discussions throughout our case study, projects and assignments. We exchange opinions openly and look at a problem from different perspectives.<br><img src="http://ww4.sinaimg.cn/mw690/72a818edgw1erd01xzlofj20zk0k0n2d.jpg" alt=""><br>Events outside the classroom it is much more than amusement.<br>I like it when people do not judge others here. During all the remarkable activities we’ve had here, people embrace the diversified opinions and encourage all kinds of success. This encouraging spirit in return creates more opportunities and a prosperous society.<br>I will graduate in one month, and I am really grateful to what I have learnt here. I took data mining and decision models; I also took management and practicum. With all these years’ experience, I believe I am more competitive in my dreaming career, working with science, working with people.<br><img src="http://ww1.sinaimg.cn/mw690/72a818edgw1erd01zmk8dj20zk0k00tn.jpg" alt=""></p>

    <updated>2015-02-17T02:08:15.000Z</updated>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Half a year ago, I was frequently asked the same question, “how do you like it here?” My answer was basically the same, “I like it! People are nice here.”<br>It sounds a little disappointing, a common, general answer; but I was sincere. Based on my limited experience in this small town at that time, my strongest feeling was people were surprisingly nice! The waitress at Enzo’s helped us make a choice when we were lost in front of the huge menu. The delivery man from UPS waved to me every time he met me at my neighbourhood. Drivers at crossroads always let me pass first with a warm smile. I felt delighted and gratified although I had no furniture at home and barely knew anyone.<br>After six months of study and several trips around North Carolina, now I can contribute more to my answer.<br>I like it when people do not judge others here. I realized the fact when I was visiting a friend in New York. She was cooking for us and I asked, why do you wash vegetable like that? I usually do it this way… Suddenly I felt odd because nobody here talked like that. It had been a long time since I heard indifferent judgement from others. People respect different opinions and encourage you to use your own voice. They have various ways to define right, good and success. While in the place where I grow up, we tend to have a more monotonous set of values.<br>When I was in high school, one day my mom was talking with her American friend. The man proudly told us that his little son was determined to become a chef. We were so surprised by his contented expression since at that time my family’s biggest wish was sending me to the best college in China. We could not imagine raising a child to become a chef made someone a successful parent.<br>In my view this encouraging spirit comes from a highly developed society, where most industries and businesses have grown into relatively a matured status. Therefore people have a more comprehensive understanding of all walks of life; additionally, no matter what kind of career you choose, it will not be too difficult to obtain the resources and allies required to realize your goal. In return, more opportunities are springing out in this prosperous society; this creates a flourishing cycle of the productive force .<br>This cycle should be a natural outcome of development. So I believe someday in the future we will also have a more inclusive attitude towards others’ choices in China. For now I do enjoy our less industrialized society in some ways. Everything has huge potential to grow and no fixed pattern has formed yet. Not to mention we have the best food in the world!<br><img src="http://ww1.sinaimg.cn/bmiddle/72a818edjw1eixk1yqkhzg2074074x6q.gif" alt="Chinese Food"></p>

<p>This was the question I asked to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=82282778&amp;authType=NAME_SEARCH&amp;authToken=edTS&amp;locale=en_US&amp;trk=tyah2&amp;trkInfo=tarId%3A1422059506555%2Ctas%3Aparikh%2Cidx%3A1-4-4" target="_blank" rel="external">Mr. Parikh</a> in today’s seminar, the Marketing Scientist from <a href="http://www.maxpoint.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">MaxPoint</a>. Due to my last job in digital marketing, I am always attracted by this topic. The real-time online analysis is completely changing the way of campaigns and will bring us undistracted advertising experience online. As long as it keeps anonymous, it is a most efficient way to target customers and win profits. But yes, more people are worrying about this rapid developing technology. Despite their  ignorance of this technology itself, stories like  iCloud leak and Edward Snowden just proved the growing risks of online information collection.<br>Asking me, I think it will but I do not know what to do. <em>I was born in China I never fight against policies :)</em> That is why I asked Mr. Parikh. With several years experience in digital advertising I believed he would have some deep insights on this question.<br>And he did.<br>“I wish it won’t”, he smiled. But it is possible; especially we have seen some similar cases in other countries already. For example Europe has the most strict <a href="http://www.cookielaw.org/faq/#Isthecookielawdead" target="_blank" rel="external">Cookie Laws</a>. And you can barely use Google Analytics in China due to regional restrictions. <em>Why didn’t I think about this before?! I had been suffering from it!</em> Even though the situation could be cruel, the bright side is policies having such heavy influence are usually implemented gradually, which leaves the industry adequate time to prepare. Then we will react accordingly. It is undeniable that to make money, and with the money on hand, companies need to make advertisements. Internet is the most convenient, accurate and efficient way to do it. So we will follow this path and strive for a solution. </p>
<p>I am pretty contented with this answer. It not only cleared my doubts of this industry, but also showed me a meticulous way to think. When I said yes, I believe digital advertising will be affected by policies; it was more like my gut: it caused crisis; it could be dangerous; so people are fighting against it. But he looked at a bigger picture; referred to historical and ongoing cases, which would lead the way to solutions. The logic is easy to follow and convincing, making me think I could come up with that as well. But if I could, why would I ask ;)<br>The environment I grew up in makes me worry about asking questions.  What if it is a naive question? What if I actually can solve it myself? What if the other person refuses to answer? Now you see, asking to a mature thinker teaches you to become a mature thinker. </p>
<p>And by the way, this one-hour seminar was almost filled with students’ questions from all aspects, career, MEM Program, industry, etc. Mr. Parikh insightfully answered all questions without any preparation. Very impressive. </p>

    <updated>2015-01-21T00:04:19.000Z</updated>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A brief introduction of my work experience, required by our Internship Assessment class. It explains the reasons of taking this job, introduce the company as well as the position, and the takeaways from this experience.</p>
<p>In my fourth year of college, I decided not to keep pursuing academic study in microelectronics after graduation; instead, I realized that I was more interested in meeting different people and intrigued with their unique qualities. So I believed that a marketing position would both fulfill my interest and make use of my strength. Although it was not a small transformation from engineering to an interpersonal job, I still got an internship in a corporate communication department due to my experience in the campus TV station and other students’ activities. This position provided me with a basic understanding of the operation of an international company, strengthened my communication skills, and confirmed my determination to work in a marketing department. After the six-month internship, I applied for a marketing executive position with Henkel China. This position was mainly responsible for online marketing in the Greater China area. Thanks to my internship experience and the decently conducted interviews, I finally got this job.</p>
<p>Henkel is a German chemical company well known for its adhesive products and home care cosmetics. In China, Henkel has shown strong growth in the industrial adhesives market since 2000. The new century witnessed an increasing number of companies benefiting from the rapid development of the internet, which made Henkel, a traditional industrial business, also consider keeping up with the times. Therefore, Henkel China decided to establish an e-business function in its marketing department; and I was honored to be hired, mainly in charge of this function.</p>
<p>Initially my job included maintaining the corporate websites and conducting online campaigns. But just as the rapid growth of the internet, new problems related to online issues kept springing up unexpectedly. During the first two years of this job, I got the chance to implement various projects such as search engine optimization, online authentication and ecommerce management. Some of these projects were entirely new to the company. Luckily my boss always encouraged us to learn from different sources, which made this job challenging and worthwhile. As time went on, I became more familiar with the company operation and then was appointed to also take responsibility for the media relation issues. Contact with media was more complicated than I expected, since media agencies tended to hold their own values and ideas tightly. It required thorough communication tactics to consociate journalists from different agencies to benefit the company’s reputation.</p>
<p>One of the most important things I have learned from my three-year work experience is to always prepare yourself to adapt to this changing society. Even when you feel that everything is under control, it is better to get equipped for what might happen next. I can still remember that when I first entered the e-business field in 2011, basically most of the job was to promote the corporate websites and to maintain email marketing. But it only took less than a year for the company to shift its emphasis to mobile devices and ecommerce. During the second and third years, the boundary between online of offline marketing became more and more ambiguous; integrated marketing required collaboration from all functions of the marketing department. Consequently, my responsibilities changed as well.</p>
<p>Another takeaway I received from this job was how to balance various voices in the work place. Comparably, academic study is more straightforward since you only need to consider gaining good grades; and most of the time you just interact with classmates and professors. While during work, generally there is more than one project going on; and they usually involve tangling with different departments and bureaus who have their own interests and purposes. A coordinator in these kinds of projects should not only assure all voiced are heard, but also strive for greater benefits for the company. </p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is the first assignment of our Management class. We need to read a story about Eugene Kranz before answering the following questions. The Story is from Michael Useem’s book, <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=yv1E1-7vINYC&amp;pg=PT72&amp;lpg=PT72&amp;dq=eugene+kranz+returns+apollo+13+to+earth&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=05--zIVYHl&amp;sig=i2YqU52zGXSv-I0euAXzisgQSKA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=z6i9VP2aEYGcNrrpgpgK&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=eugene%20kranz%20returns%20apollo%2013%20to%20earth&amp;f=false" target="_blank" rel="external">The Leadership Moment</a>, <strong>Chapter 3, Eugene Kranz Returns Apollo 13 to Earth</strong>.<br>The first two questions are about your understanding of the story. The third question is about yourself, to evaluate your strengths and shortcomings as a manager or a leader.<br><strong>Instructor</strong>: Professor Ted Ryan</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>PRE-CRISIS Preparation</strong>: In his two years as Flight Director prior to Apollo 13’s crisis, Kranz implemented a number of innovative organizational initiatives.  What were Kranz’ key organizational initiatives – BEFORE the crisis occurred – that turned out to be critical to the successful return of Apollo 13?  For each innovative initiative you cite, state why/how it became critical to Apollo 13’s safe return.<br><em>Note: These initiatives were “management” and/or “leadership” initiatives – but for now, don’t worry about whether an initiative was more management or leadership.</em></p>
<p>First, Kranz had <strong>comprehensive understanding of his team members</strong>. He knew not only their strengths, but also their shortcomings and how to stimulate their full potential based on his understanding. Therefore, in a time-critical and true emergency environment, Kranz could assign the right people on right positions. For example, when recruiting Bill Peters from the Gold Team, despite the doubt from other flight directors, Kranz believed that Peters’ exceptional experience would be crucial to the crisis, while he might need someone “to bring out the pieces”. The same situation happened when recruiting John Aaron as well. Naturally, these people did not let Kranz down. We can say that, everyone in the team was dealing with the task he/she was expert in. Consequently each function of the team just needed to focus on its own problem. The absence of disturbance was one of the key factors to make prompt and accurate decisions.<br>In addition to Kranz’ own familiarity with the team, he particularly devoted attention to the <strong>team’s efficiency when working together</strong>. As mentioned in the case, “its members had developed the ability to compensate for each other when the chips get down”. His effort included encouraging the team members to know one another, and then to communicate and trust one another. He arranged his flight teams into their own baseball league and the team challenged the astronaut teams on the football field. The active team-building events consolidated the team together and established strong reliance among multiple teams. As a result, even under the most critical circumstance, people in Room 210 functioned methodically. Similarly, during the early period of the crisis, Kranz could restructure the team and regroup people across levels, between outside contractors and inside employees without concerns.<br>These two innovative initiatives guaranteed both Kranz and his team the access to all required resources. And these people had been long prepared for working in the most efficient way. Therefore they could reach an optimal conclusion under severe pressure.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Kranz’ Attributes/Behaviors</strong>:  Our reading describes how Kranz prepared himself technically for his responsibilities as Flight Director.  He was superbly trained and had great technological expertise.  However, it is clear that Kranz’ technological competence alone was not enough for him to lead Apollo 13 safely back to earth.  What were Kranz’ most important NON-technical characteristics that enabled him to lead Apollo 13 to a successful conclusion?</p>
<p>First, Kranz’ <strong>calmness</strong> was crucial of successfully managing this crisis. Although technological expertise and comprehensive experience were the foundation of calmness, this characteristic required continual training other than growing naturally. Throughout the crisis, Kranz kept seeking orderly analysis. Other than blind optimism, it ensured that Kranz could objectively evaluate the situation and then make accurate decision.<br>We cannot neglect Kranz’ <strong>infectious personal</strong> characteristic as well, which was shown in many details during the accident. For example, As soon as Kranz realized the sign of panic in Mission control, he started to influence the team with encouraging suggestions. “Let’s solve the problem.” “Let’s not make it any worse by guessing”. During the crisis, he exhorted his team to concentrate on “what was working, rather than focusing on what was not”. He believed optimistic might not be sufficiency to a favorable outcome, but definitely necessity. So he used his influence to arouse the team’s morale. The smooth cooperation of the Tiger Team under such huge pressure proved this point of view. </p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Your Readiness to Manage and Lead</strong>:  You may not face a crisis as severe as a crippled spaceship, with a crew in jeopardy.  However, as an engineering manager, you will quickly face serious challenges that will test you.  Suppose you were faced with a serious organizational challenge today.  How ready are you? </p>
<p>a. List three <strong>positive personal non-technical qualities/behaviors</strong> that would help you manage/lead others, especially in difficult circumstances. For each of these qualities/ behaviors, describe a practical step you can take to strengthen them further.</p>
<p>i.    <strong>Calmness</strong><br>Kranz’ successful story proved how important calmness could be, especially in critical circumstances. I believe most of my calmness comes from my various work and projects experience. As analyzed in Kranz’ case, this positive attitude usually based on one’s qualification in certain situations. Or it will become blind optimism, which cannot be helpful at all.<br>Therefore I need to equip myself with adequate industrial knowledge. Then cultivate the habits of simulating potential hardness and seeking for multiple solutions. Theses habits will prepare me for different kinds of unexpected difficulties and accidents.</p>
<p>ii.    <strong>Accountable</strong><br>Accountable is a reputation earned through long-time effective work, strong team spirit and last but not the least, honesty towards failures. This reputation assures more challenging management positions when accidents happen.<br>At present, being accountable is relatively easy because the projects I have dealt with are less complex. While I should regard them as good opportunities to strengthen my accountability. A strictly conducted agenda is definitely good to keep the project on time. Making reasonable commitment is more practical in crisis than setting unrealistic goals. Getting to know the team eliminates the risk when working together. As a student or entry level employee, mistakes and failures usually do not cause chaotic consequences. But learning from them is beneficial in the long term. This attitude will also increase the reputation of accountability. </p>
<p>iii.    <strong>Structure</strong><br>The characteristic of being organized can effectively avoid panic, confusion and flurry when crisis comes. Academic study is a well structured environment where classes are arranged at fixed time and syllabuses show exactly the tasks in the semester. I believe students tend to have a good structured analysis methodology. While in real working environment, more constraints, roles, resources will be involved.<br>Actually the project charter we write in every case study report is very helpful to strengthen the ability of structurally thinking. It is t. At first this section might be regarded just as a compulsory part of the report. But as time goes by I realize that a project charter is not just for the readers to grasp a rough idea of the situation. It shows my understanding of this project. To compose a concise project charter instructs me to read the case with structured purposes from the very beginning.<br>In addition to the case studies required by classes, I can also develop this characteristic through learning my own cases. The stories can come from news, exchanging experience with others and extending the classroom study from documents. </p>
<p>b. List three of your <strong>weaker qualities/behaviors</strong> – areas of vulnerability that you will need to change and develop in order to manage/lead others effectively, especially in difficult circumstances. Refer to your Personal Development Plan.  For each of these qualities/behaviors, describe a practical step you can take to strengthen them.</p>
<p>i.    <strong>Flexibility</strong><br>I do like well-organized projects. As a result, it may cause the lack of flexibility.<br>First of all, overcome the upset feelings towards changes. With a positive attitude to uncertainties, I shall strength my adaptability through experiences. Try not to focus on the events I am used to. New challenges bring fresh opportunities and increase the possibility of meeting with changes. With more experience of dealing with changes, I shall become more skilled at anticipating potential incidents. </p>
<p>ii.    <strong>Patience</strong><br>One of the vulnerabilities I have now is that I tend to become impatient when facing people with totally different background from me, especially when we fail to understand each other after several attempts.<br>Considering the responsibilities of a manager or a leader, patience is so important in that this character is always tangling with people from different industries with various personalities. And the key mission is to unite these people working together towards a common purpose.<br>To get in touch with people from other industries will obviously be helpful. It will broaden my understanding of different fields. Possible channels include personal network, industrial events and public media. When conducting these interactions, keep in mind that the conversation should not be limited to our shared topics. Instead, I need to encourage the other person to talk about his or her work experience and insights on the industry. It will not only enrich my knowledge, but also train my skills of obtaining brand new ideas. When misunderstanding or confusion occurs, try to use another way of expression or seek for an analogy familiar by both sides, other than emphasizing the same sentence repeatedly.</p>
<p>iii.    <strong>Maturity</strong><br>I do not think maturity equals to insensibility. Instead, it is more about regulate the emotion, especially under severe pressures. Comparing to calmness, which is mainly towards the situation, maturity includes a comprehensive management of emotions for events as well as human beings.<br>When mingling with different people, pay attention to their characteristics and behavior pattern. This experience will help to form thorough tactics of communication and interaction. This ability can also be cultivated through textbook learning. One of the recommendations is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Berne" target="_blank" rel="external">Eric Berne</a>’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transactional_analysis" target="_blank" rel="external">Transactional Analysis</a>.<br>In addition, a proper way of relieving stress should be developed. It can be reading, exercise or meditation.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Marketing was quite an inspiring class for me, even considering that I had been working with a competitive marketing team for three years.<br>Our instructor, Professor Kathie Amato had all kinds of incredible ideas to arouse people’s initiative. During the four-month’s study, in addition to the regular lectures, we watched countless fascinating commercials, had snacks to keep the colorful packages as name tags, did a double blind test among different brands soda which is exactly the thing I wished to do for a long time. And yes, my classmates continually surprised me with their creative point of views!<br>The cases we studied covered industries including food, transportation, medicine, travel and FMCG. We were required to deliver three slides after self studying each case. Then we would discuss, or should I say, fight against each other, about what we had digged out from the case. It was really insightful to have tens of people with all kinds of backgrounds sitting together, sharing opinions. I used to believe I was the one thinking out of the box. <strong>But here I realized that there is always a box out of my box!</strong><br>At first it was not easy to squeeze all the conclusions into only three slides. Right, lack of concision is the sign of inexperience. But gradually, I could deal with not only the content itself, no matter it was quantitative analysis or qualitative statement, but also the artwork! I just have an obsession with well-arranged, good-looking slides design. Maybe that is one of the assets I have recieved from marketing experience. </p>

The skyscrapers drop your hat when you try to count the floors; the crowd pushes you to move no matter you want or not; the luxury brands shine in windows innocently towards tourists from all around the world; the traffic is always terrible in downtown area; people with different backgrounds and religions gather in their own group but get along with each others as well.<br>I do enjoy the clear blue sky here, which is becoming more and more rare in Shanghai these years. If ignoring some of the old, sticky, creepy subway stations, this should be a nice city to live in.<br>Anyway, I properly used my imaginations to the pictures taken in New York City.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is the final project from our Data Mining course in Fall semester 2014. It was really exciting to have thirty students from this class study on one topic, Ebola. Especially at that time it was quite a hot topic in the news. Professor Egger divided this huge topic into several sub topics so each of us can focus on one aspect of the study. And mine was <strong>Role of Important US Organizations in the Fight Against Ebola</strong>. </p>
<ul>
<li>This project aimed to study the extent that the financial and medical assistance from the U.S. will help control the epidemic; furthermore, the project intended to identify whether the promised support will be sufficient in the next 6 – 12 months. </li>
<li>An SEIR model was built up to estimate the future numbers of cases and to evaluate the amount of assistance that will be needed. </li>
<li>Considering that the U.S., U.K. and France are dividing some responsibilities for fighting the Ebola outbreak in West Africa along colonial-era lines2, this study mainly focused on the situation in Liberia; while general analysis on Guinea and Sierra Leone was also conducted.</li>
<li>All analysis was based on data available as of November 15, 2014.</li>
</ul>
<p>We were required to study independently on our own topics and make a poster showing all our study results. At the final presentation, we had fifteen minutes to illustrate our study using the poster; meanwhile, we had the opportunity to share our takeaways with our peers.<br>I have to say that this poster is much more delicate when seeing in screen than printed. But on the other hand, I obtained the experience of designing a professional sized poster. One of the features I was most proud of was that I used QR code to present my references instead of the traditional URLs. Obviously it is much more convenient for the audience to scan the QR code when viewing the poster. Maybe it will become a trend in the near future. </p>

Kent Bowen and Courtney Purrington</p>
<p>Our team were assigned to present our study result during the class. I attached the presentation slides at the end of this report.</p>
<p><strong>Created by</strong><br>Master of Engineering Management Program,<br>Duke University<br><strong>Class of 2013</strong>: Akash Gupta, Aaron Shakin<br><strong>Class of 2014</strong>: Mohammad Ali Raahim, Lian Liu</p>
<h2 id="Executive_Summary">Executive Summary</h2>
<p>Our team was contracted by Tritec, a team formed by the joint venture between Chrysler and BMW to select an appropriate solution for the engine block sealing design. The purpose of the joint venture was to capitalize on the opportunities in Asia and Latin America for low cost engines ranging in size from 1.0 – 1.6 liters. After discussing, the joint team decided to establish an engine plant in Brazil, as Chrysler believed other emerging countries were too risky and the overall project would be led by Jack Smith.<br>Our team needed to analyze and resolve the differences between the product engineering and the advanced manufacturing team. The advanced manufacturing team believed that the lower tie bar design selected by the product engineering team is impractical, as it would necessitate reinventing part of the machining process, which would be difficult.<br>We used a four-fold method to define success and select the best design. Based on our findings, our recommendation is the bedplate design, since it proved to be the most favorable option in three of these five categories.<br>… …</p>
<h2 id="Project_Charter">Project Charter</h2>
<p>Approval: The proposed plan would need a formal approval from the Tritec Management. Approval will depend on the feasibility of the analysis presented in the report and the consent of the product engineering and advanced manufacturing teams who are primary stakeholders.<br>Resources: The resources for development of each selected project type will be assigned based on approval from management. Additional resources could be assigned subject to approval and requirement.<br>Project Manager: The Project Manager (PM) for the joint venture between BMW and Chrysler is Jack Smith. He is considered a talented manufacturing engineer with advanced degrees in mechanical engineering. He was concerned about his lack of experience but the management assured him he would be provided with necessary resources.</p>
<h3 id="Problem_Statement">Problem Statement</h3>
<p><strong>Current State:</strong> Tritec is currently facing a dilemma with regard to the engine block design. The product engineering team believed that a lower tie bar design would help decrease anticipated warranty costs and would be more reliable, while the advanced manufacturing team believed that this design would necessitate the reinvention of the machining process which would create an added challenge.<br>Future State: We envision that the selected design will satisfy both the product engineering team and the advanced manufacturing engineering team based on the thorough analysis. The chosen design would also help Tritec develop an engine that would make the joint venture achieve profitable growth with less risk.<br><strong>Constraints:</strong> The limitations of risk, design feasibility and future impact were among the constraints considered.  Time and budget are perhaps the most important constraints in this endeavor.  There are check points to gauge progress throughout the building process of the engines, but ultimately, it is imperative for Tritec to implement a sealing design that helps achieve its  mission of building “the world’s lowest overall cost engine business in the city of Campo Largo, Brazil by July 2000” (mission idea is from Team 8’s report; quote from page 8 of the case). </p>
<h2 id="Design_Selection_Approach">Design Selection Approach</h2>
<p>The design selection approach was based on a number of metrics. In order to arrive at the recommended design, a comparative analysis was carried out to weigh the strengths and weaknesses of each design. Using this approach, the first order of business was to define an empirical criteria/definition for a successful design within the constraints of the Tritec team’s design and manufacturing capabilities. Keeping the available data in mind, the following criteria were defined:</p>
<ol>
<li>Conformance/positive impact on the 12-panel objectives</li>
<li>Design favorability, in terms of investment, variable cost, manufacturing, workload etc.</li>
<li>Sealing design and process risk</li>
<li>Warranty assessment</li>
</ol>
<p>The design that performed best on the above set of criteria was deemed as the most suitable one for the project team to pursue.<br>Conformance/positive impact on the 12-panel objectives<br>Exhibit 18 scored each design approach on the 12-panel objectives spelled out to gauge the progress of the project. The original tie bar design served as the reference, while the two alternatives either got a 0 (indicating performance at-par with the original design), a positive (indicating a relative advantage) or a negative (indicating a relative disadvantage) on each of the 12 objectives.<br>In our approach, we summed up the impact ratings to arrive at a final score for each design. By default, the original tie bar design had a score of 0, while analysis of the other two designs revealed the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bedplate design had a score of -1</li>
<li>Rear retainer style had a score of -4</li>
<li>Conclusion: In terms of positive impact on the 12-panel objectives, the original tie bar design performed the best with a score of 0. The bedplate design, however, was a close second.<h3 id="Design_favorability">Design favorability</h3>
Next, each of the designs was evaluated on the basis of favorability. The data was obtained from Exhibit 17. A higher summary total score indicated more favorability. The number was obtained by taking a weighted sum of the ratings assigned to each design approach based on a number of practical implementation aspects. The following results were gleaned from the data:</li>
<li>Bedplate design had the highest summary total of 158, followed by the rear retainer style design with 137</li>
<li>Conclusion: Bedplate design has the most favorable design review</li>
</ul>
<p>… …</p>
<h3 id="Assumptions_used_in_the_approach">Assumptions used in the approach</h3>
<ol>
<li>It was assumed that the 4.7L comparison of bore centers and access issues will not reveal any risk, thus arriving at a total process risk score of 682 for the bedplate design. As the design in question was not the leading performer in this category, the assumption did not have any impact on the result. </li>
<li>The “?” for the timing objective in Exhibit 18 was assumed to have a value of 0. Again, assuming it was either an advantage or disadvantage would not have had any impact on the conclusion derived from the 12-panel criterion.</li>
<li>The supplier tooling cost in the case of bedplate is assumed to be the same as the other two designs ($307,000).</li>
<li>The variable costs remain the same for each of the five years considered in the cost analysis.<br>Evaluation of Project Procedure and Management Process </li>
</ol>
<h2 id="Management_Group">Management Group</h2>
<p>The management group from the very beginning of this project lacked effective communication and interactive approaches with team members. More often than not, the team members were speculating the reasons for unexpected results, instead of being involved in the decision making. For example, Chrysler held the very first meeting with BMW before the team reached to any other companies. BMW Board Director Dr. Reitzle, then accepted Chrysler’s proposal despite the objectives from his engineers.<br>These assertive decisions brought some unforeseen trouble when proceeding with the project. As we can see now, the successor team was not satisfied with the outcome from the predecessor team, since their opinion was not considered thoroughly. Additionally, the overlooking of team members’ comments reduced their loyalty to the company and consequently compromised the prestige of the management group. </p>
<h3 id="Team_Structure_and_Management">Team Structure and Management</h3>
<p>From Exhibits 5, 6 and 7 we can tell that, although each company accounted for half of the Joint Venture Steering Committee, more than two thirds of the Tritec staff leaders were from Chrysler, further imbalanced by recent staff recruits. This skewed organization chart meant that when the committee was negotiating the proposal for reaching an agreement beneficial to both sides, the implementation would likely face resistance from the execution teams either due to the different interests or different corporate cultures.<br>Another considerable problem from the team structure was that most of the execution team leaders had ten years or even more than twenty years of experience in this field, while the project manager, Jack Smith was only 33 years old and had been recently selected to run Chrysler’s van assembly plant. This disparity in experience would make it difficult for the project manager to have his decisions carried out effectively. Chrysler did provide Smith with experienced people in this project as promised, but their experience may not be entirely beneficial with a young project manager. </p>
<h3 id="Project_Manager">Project Manager</h3>
<p>Some issues regarding the project manager’s fit with this joint venture and his approach to situations he encountered may have inhibited the ability of the project to run seamlessly.  To begin with, the project manager, Jack Smith was not involved in this project until November 1996, which was almost one year after the first meeting between Chrysler and BMW. Before he joined, the engineers from both teams had already gone through some of the design details and reached an agreement to some extent. The project manager’s absence from the early period of a project led to inadequate understanding of the project’s scope. Despite the fact that Smith joined the project shortly before the agreement was signed, it still took substantial time for him to become familiar with the team and their ideas. To a certain degree, this resulted in subsequent conflicts and inefficient communication afterwards.<br>Furthermore, in a cross-functional team, especially one that has members from two companies with different corporate cultures, the project manager is particularly responsible for the team’s collaboration as well as project control. Although Smith had education and plant experience in mechanical engineering, he lacked sufficient capability in running large, complex operations. The approaches he adopted to manage the team, such as the creation of a Tritec contract book and having many meetings and workshops were techniques based on coping with ideal circumstances, without consideration of the actual situation. The revisions of the contract book proved that Smith was willing to allow proper evaluations and corresponding adjustments according to the feedback; but undoubtedly this protracted delivery had lost much of the impact on some early design decisions. </p>
<h3 id="Suggested_Actions_for_Successful_Implementation">Suggested Actions for Successful Implementation</h3>
<p>In view of the above mentioned facts, and to ensure this project moves forward smoothly, we have four suggestions for procedures and management processes as follows.</p>
<ol>
<li>Make a decision of the sealing design as soon as possible. Since points of view have been expressed sufficiently, a final decision is possible with mutual understanding using the detailed analysis demonstrated above. </li>
<li>Explore a more effective communication approach between the management group and the execution teams. Instead of frequent dogmatic meetings, the management should pay more attention to their employees and make sure the decisions are understood by everyone involved. </li>
<li>Improve the team dynamics, especially for the interaction between the Advanced Manufacturing Engineering team and the other engineers. Moving the team off-site in the middle of the project is not a good first option; but technology and commuting support can be optimized if it is needed. </li>
<li>Support the current project manager with team alignment by providing the assistance of a senior employee with more practical experience in cross-functional team management. </li>
</ol>
<h2 id="Risks_and_Best_Practices_for_Addressing_Them">Risks and Best Practices for Addressing Them</h2>
<p>While the bedplate design appears to have more advantages than the other two alternatives, it does not come without risks and potential drawbacks.  One of these risks is the condensed time frame for redesigning the lower end of the engine block.  To overcome this risk, staff would need to be reallocated to concentrate on designing in order to meet the “OK to tool” milestone. Reassigning individuals to design roles who have minimal training and experience presents another risk.  Therefore, project manager, Jack Smith should also consider hiring new employees specialized in design.  While it would be costly to hire new designers to help accelerate this stage, there still is an estimated $5 million in reserve, which could be put towards bringing on extra staff to compensate for lost time.<br>The bedplate design comes with an added $8 million involved in bedplate machining that is not required for the other two designs.  Bedplate machining would also entail two extra assembly lines in the machining process which increases the amount of interdependency involved and the likelihood of delays.  Tritec can attempt to find a reliable subcontractor to machine the bedplate at a lower cost than Tritec would otherwise have, for purchasing the extra machining equipment and doing the machining of the bedplate themselves.  Finding a vendor that already has the necessary equipment for making the bedplate and experienced machinists with this step, would alleviate risks involved in bedplate manufacturing and eliminate one of the added assembly lines, as long as there would not be any excessive delays involved for order processing and shipping time.<br>Another risk involved in the investment for the bedplate is the unknown cost of supplier tooling.  As shown in Exhibit 13, the supplier tooling is listed as “TBD” for the bedplate while the other two designs have costs of $307,000.  To address the risk involved in this uncertain expense, Tritec must determine approximate costs for supplier tooling options that are available, and then make a conservative estimate based on this data, so that the expense can be factored into the projected investment.  If the cost is on the same order of magnitude as the supplier tooling costs for the other two design alternatives, then it will not have a significant impact on the total investment, and there would still be some reserve funds remaining.</p>
<h2 id="Lessons_Learned">Lessons Learned</h2>
<p>This case was invaluable to us because of the added stipulation of not being able to communicate face to face with teammates.  Since many project teams and consulting companies have individuals in different locations, meetings where all members are physically present are not always practical, particularly for tasks that can be orchestrated remotely.  We treated this process similarly to the how we conducted previous team meetings for prior cases, except in this situation, our meetings were done through Google Hangout sessions.  While it seemed as though this requirement would present an extra challenge, we felt that we could still turn in quality work, as we had before.  In some respects, meeting remotely made it less of a challenge to arrange meetings, since all group members did not need to be in the same location.<br>Having a few weeks available to complete this assignment, we found it advantageous to make the most of the time available.  On previous cases, there seemed to be an excess of work that was saved until the day before the deadline, which inevitably prevented us from doing the most thorough job we could, with proofreading and formatting of the report.  We learned that it would be helpful to establish a deadline for completing a draft of the report a full week before it was due, to provide us with ample time for revising it.  Furthermore, our team was assigned to potentially present on this case, meaning that we needed to factor time into the preparation process for creating a comprehensive and captivating presentation of our group strategy in this case.  Projects in the workplace may often have long term schedules, but as we have realized, beginning the process earlier, creates a less stressful atmosphere at the deadline, particularly when other pressing assignments show up with little or no warning.<br>Finally, we learned to cooperate with our partner team, Team 8, during preparation of this case.  Since one group would be presenting on behalf of both teams, it was imperative for us to share ideas with Team 8 in order to get the benefit of having eight individuals to collaborate with.  We decided that it would be best to come up with solutions to the case as two independent teams in order to generate alternative ways of choosing a strategy and then have a large Google Hangout session with all members from both teams, to see what each team had come up with.  This method would allow the two teams to critique the other’s approach and offer suggestions as constructive feedback from peers who are familiar with the information of the case.  Furthermore, having the other team’s perspective could give us new ideas about the case, which could be incorporated into our presentation and evaluated beside our initial methodology.  Having more mental capacity than any individual can provide is one important advantage of working in teams.  Therefore, having eight individuals collaborating increased the potential from </p>
<h2 id="Summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Tritec Motors’ initial lower tie bar engine block sealing design was deemed inadequate because it would not be able to keep up with the high volume production that was needed.  The design process was difficult to replicate if it was going to be done at different stations.  Without consistency in machining, quality assurance for this design would become an issue and as much as 25 percent of the cylinder blocks would need to be discarded.  This was a significant concern, which could lead to an unwanted increase in costs.<br>Two alternative designs of a rear retainer style and a bedplate design were proposed by project engineers and compared against several criteria: maximum positive impact on the 12 panel objectives (Exhibit 18), most favorable design based on factors such as sealing, design workload, assembly, and service (Exhibit 17), lowest risk with respect to design and process (Exhibits 15 and 16), and lowest amount of warranty conditions per thousand (Exhibit 14).  For the 12 panel objectives, the original tie bar design proved to be more preferable than both the bedplate and the rear retainer designs.  With respect to the factors analyzed in Exhibit 17, the bedplate design had an overall score which was higher than both alternatives.  The bedplate was the option with the lowest risk under Design Failure Mode and Effects Analysis and the second lowest risk under Process Failure Mode and Effects Analysis.  The bedplate design also finished with best warranty score, having the lowest estimated conditions per thousand.  Since the bedplate design proved to be the superior engine sealing design option in three of the five distinct categories and neither of the other two alternatives scored the highest in more than one of the categories, it was a clear decision that the bedplate design should be chosen.<br>In addition, management could be improved in this project with better communication as well as superior collaboration and support between the project staff and project manager, Jack Smith.   With management concerns addressed and risks mitigated appropriately, selection of the bedplate engine block sealing design should enable the Tritec engine joint venture to be a successful project that is capable of being completed within both time and budget constraints.</p>
<p>Looking back at the slides I made for our presentation, it appears not professional at all! At least I do not feel proud of this work as I did several months ago. Well, the structure is easy to follow; the content is concise. But I believe I can come up with better design. So it should be pasted here to remind me that, I need to work harder to satisfy myself in the future.</p>
